							<p>Estatement comes with an awesome custom field system. This system allows you to manage your properties extremely flexibly and with as little hassle as possible. Whenever you create a property you can add "details" to it. These details are split into two groups: global details and specific details</p>
<p>Global details are shown for each and every property you have, making data entry quick and painless. You can choose the type of data (dropdown, text field, checkboxes, etc. ), and then just add everything you need for each property.</p>
<p>Specific details can also be added on a property-to-property basis. These details are minor additions which are not applicable to all properties.</p>
<p>The video below is a quick into to the theme, but it also contains an extensive section on managing your custom fields.</p>

<h2>Default Fields</h2>
<p>To set which details should be shown next to apartments by default go to Custom Fields-&gt;Default Fields and select the fields you would like shown in the top box. These can usually be overwritten for specific situations (widgets, shortcodes, etc.).</p>
<h2>Property Subtitle</h2>
<p>The fields shown in the property subtitle can be customized by going to Custom Fields-&gt;Default Fields and selecting the fields to show, and their order, in the second box on the screen. The  details selected will then be shown under the main title in various locations. </p>
